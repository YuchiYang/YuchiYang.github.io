Yuchi's story idea
Deceased people find themselves in the messenger app

open a chat with a bunch of guys
welcoming and nice -need to think of a good story to introduce character into chat-
become friends and chat about things they like etc get to know them
one of them asks you to check on his dog bc hes away from home
you find out his dog is gone, you're surprised and confused
the guy is worried so he asks you to ask his friend about his dog
when you get to his friends house his friend freaks out
his friend tells you ___ passed away a year ago
don't know what to do

OPTION A tell him
you tell him the truth about him being dead
he freaks out and doesnt believe you insists hes alive, just abroad
you guys discuss this in the group chat
find out everyone else in the group chat has also deceased
panic ensues
chat with people to find out why they're here in this app
find out slowly how they died
-scientist experimenting on brain restorement like those nitrogen sci fi things,
expeirmented on transferring memories from dead people into this app to see if you can live after death by creating individual thoughts
you can choose to help these people find out what happend by finding this doctor

OPTION B lie to him and tell him his dog is fine
everything goes on as usual and you ask when he will be back
says he'll be back in april when school is over
you wait- needs some story here idk right now-
doesn't show up, says hes here at the place to meet you but you're not here
youre both confused
realize hes living in a virtual reality.
-repeat option A where you ask others find out theyre all dead, find scientist
